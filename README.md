#  Coffee Sales Data Analysis with PostgreSQL

This project presents an in-depth **data analysis on coffee product sales** across multiple cities using **PostgreSQL**. It involves schema design, data modeling, and writing complex SQL queries to derive business insights.


## Overview

The dataset is modeled with four main entities:
- `city`: Information about different cities, including population and rent estimates.
- `customers`: Customers located in specific cities.
- `products`: Coffee product listings with pricing.
- `sales`: Detailed records of sales transactions, including date, product, customer, amount, and rating.
